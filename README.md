## EasyView
### it's better to see once

EasyView is an application that allows to see 3D-BIM models without any special programs, right on web page in any browser including mobile devices.

It aims to replace usual 3D-viewer programs in terms of availability of models, because in many cases it matters.

3D models of buildings in IFC format are stored on server and provided to client via REST API.

Basically it's a complete remaster of my previous project that was made using only Django, but this time with MERN stack.

Right now it is in very early stage, and I still learn many things in process.
